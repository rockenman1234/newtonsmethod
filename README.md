# newtonsmethod
A simple math program written in pyhton, to demonsrate Newton's Method of finding roots.

*Created for Dr. Christopher Raridan's Math 1501 Class at Clayton State University.*

## Description
This is a simple program written that provides roots of user defined functions using Newton's Method of finding roots.

## New for Version 2.0!

- Added a welcome message
- Added a check for a negative derivative, with a break if the derivative is 0
- Switched from using a user defined derivative function, to a calculated derivate value using the limit definition of the derivative
- Added an interation counter
- Cleaned up the code 
- Added much needed documentation
- Codebase overhaul!


## How to Run
- First, make sure you have the latest Python3 version downloaded
  - For more information, visit: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  - These instructions use git, for information regarding git visit: https://git-scm.com/docs/gits
  
  
### Linux/MacOS 
```
git clone https://github.com/rockenman1234/newtonsmethod.git

cd ~/newtonsmethod/

python3 ./python3 newtons_method\(ver_2.0\).py

```

### Windows
```
git clone https://github.com/rockenman1234/newtonsmethod.git
```

Then open the containing folder, and copy the folder pathway; Adjust the format of the comand below

```
cd \path\to\directory\
```

Once the pathway inside the comandline matches the download directory, run the following comands in order:
```
python3 newtons_method\(ver_2.0\).py
```
